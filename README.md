# Modeling-and-Forecasting-Stock-Volatility-on-the-Johannesburg-Stock-Exchange-JSE-A-GARCH-Approach
This project applies Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models to analyze and forecast stock market volatility on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE).
The study uses Standard Bank (SBK.JO) data (downloaded via Yahoo Finance) to:

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) of stock prices and returns

Estimate volatility using GARCH(1,1) and GARCH(2,2) models

Compare model fit using AIC/BIC and parameter significance

Forecast volatility for 5–10 business days ahead

Visualize conditional volatility and forecasts

# **⚙️ Tools & Libraries**
